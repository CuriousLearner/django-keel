## Security Best Practices

Django Keel generates projects with security best practices by default:

- ‚úÖ Django's `check --deploy` runs in CI
- ‚úÖ HSTS, secure cookies, CSP headers enabled in production
- ‚úÖ Dependencies scanned with `pip-audit` and `safety`
- ‚úÖ Container images scanned with Trivy
- ‚úÖ No secrets in repository (environment-based config)
- ‚úÖ SOPS for encrypted secrets (optional)

For enhanced security, use `security_profile: strict` when generating your project.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security report:

1. We confirm the vulnerability and determine severity
2. We develop and test a fix
3. We release a patch version
4. We publicly disclose the vulnerability 7 days after the patch release
