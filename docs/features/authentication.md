# Authentication

Django Keel provides flexible authentication options to suit different project needs.

## Options

### django-allauth

Full-featured authentication system with email verification and social auth support.

### JWT (SimpleJWT)

Stateless token-based authentication perfect for API-only projects and mobile apps.

### Both

Use allauth for web and JWT for API clients - get the best of both worlds!

See the [Usage Guide](overview.md) for detailed authentication configuration and examples.
